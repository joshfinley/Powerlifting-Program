# 2/10/2025 Power Lifting and Conditionoing Program

This site / repo contains a script and its output, a 6-month comprehensive strength and conditioning plan. Why? I like having my training plan documents easy to use, read, and access. Automatic generation:

- Saves a lot of redundant copy & paste work.
- Ensures mistakes are minimized.
- Allows efficient generation of the program as HTML for use on GitHub Pages.

## Training Plan Philosophy

This 6-month plan is a concurrent approach to strength and conditioning. Years of experimenting with periodization strategies like conjugate, block, undulating, have led to this structure. The essential elements are the following:

- The program follows a four week wave structure, allowing for concurrent periodization of the main barbell lifts. 
- Giant sets and (decently) long duration cardio sessions are baked-in, in contrast to many programs.
- Protective movements are prioritized, ensuring that the hips, knees, spine, and shoulders are protected.

This design addresses (what I see) as flaws with most approaches to strength and conditioning *for ordinary people*. Many programs are optimized for competition preparation in powerlifting, bodybuilding, and strongman.
While these sports are wonderful, hyper-specilization, while effective, can be dangerous from a health perspective.

The following table compares this approach with others that I am familiar with:

| Program Type / Element                                                      | **This Program**        | Undulating | Conjugate | Block  | Linear | Cross Fit |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| Consistent heavy touches                                                    | Yes                     | Yes        | Yes       | No     | No     | No        |
| Consistent high volume                                                      | Yes                     | Yes        | Yes       | No     | No     | Kind-of?  |
| Time away from heavy touches for joint and connective tissue recovery       | Yes                     | Sometimes  | No        | Yes    | Yes    | Yes       |
| Time away from high volume for needed de-training effect & fatigue recovery | Yes                     | Sometimes  | No        | Yes    | Yes    | Yes       |
| Built-in Zone 2, 4, 5 Cardio                                                | Yes (with caveat on Z5) | Rarely     | No        | No     | No     | Mixed     |
| Built-in prehab / rehab                                                     | Yes                     | Sometimes  | Sometimes | Rarely | Rarely | Rarely    |

The way all these boxes are checked is by strategically incorporating all elements, considering the cost they have for the others:

- Consistent heavy touches: Weeks 3-4 of every 4 week wave incorporates significant heavy effort (3-1 rep range, high percentage).
- Consistent high volume: Weeks 1-2 of every 4 week wave incorporate significant high repetition work.
- Time away from heavy touches: 4-week split wave structure allows for 2 week deloads from heavy work.
- Time away from high volume: 4-week split  wave structure allows for 2 week deloads from high volume work.
- Built-in zone 2 Cardio: Every week uses a cardio day in place of a strength day for zone 2 cardio.
- Built-in zone 4/5 Cardio: Giant sets, with appropriate effort and acclimation, can be used to (hopefully) get heart rate high enough for at least zone 4.
- Built-in prehab / rehab: Accessories include single leg work with a balance element, rotational and rigiditiy core exercises, upper back work for shoulders, zero-axial load lower back work, etc.

## Wave Design

The program uses a four week wave that ramps from high volume, low intensity, to low volume, high intensity:

- Week 1: 2 x 15+ @ 62.5% (15 minimum).
- Week 2: 3 x 7 @ 76%.
- Week 3: 4 x 3 @ 86%.
- Week 4: 1 x 1 @ RPE 9-10.

Additionally, variation from month to month is added by suggesting bar rotation every eight weeks. This allows for a more long-term adaptation / de-adaptation effect.

For equipped lifters like myself, a minimum amount of gear is incorporated. Competitive equipped lifters will probably find the frequency lacking, but the benefits of higher specifity are balanced against other considerations in this program. full suit squats and deadlifts could be added every top week if desired.

## Accessory Variation

A potential drawback of this program is that, under the current setup, the same accessories will be used the entire 6 months. This could be good for some and bad for others. However, a few items work in the program's favor:

- Of the exercises included, there is high variety and coverage of natural movement patterns.
- The sheer difficulty of high effort giant sets allows for significant room for adaptation to those exercises.
  - Early in the program, it will be extremely difficult for ordinary users to complete the maximum 5 giant sets in the two primary strength sessions.
  - Additionally, it will be impossible for most to use high weight in the giant sets early on.
  - Together, these will result in a large deficit between initial and potential performance from the start to the end of the program.
- If desired, swap accessories freely.
